== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where is the Settings Page? =

Go to **Settings** >> **Notice Bar** to configure and then enable the emergency notice bar.

= Is this plugin really free? =

We thought of creating a "pro" version, but things are tough for everyone right now.  So we decided to release it for free on the WordPress.org repo as well as on GitHub.  If you like it, you'd make our day by giving us a review or, better yet, donate a couple bucks via PayPal using the donate link in the plugin settings.

= Can I add links, headings, and more to the notice? =

Absolutely, yes. The content is edited for the plugin using the familiar WordPress WYSIWYG editor, which works pretty much the same as Word.

= I need it to do something specific. How do I do that? =

We are open to suggestions and believe our plugin will evolve according to ever-chaning requirement. We are user driven and welcome your ideas. Just reach out to us via the support forums or our website.

= Can I add custom CSS? =

You may add custom CSS to your WordPress Customizer. This is done by navigating to "Appearance" >> "Customize" >> "Additional CSS".  For reference, just prepend the CSS ID, "#jdm-notice," to override any built-in CSS.

If you have any trouble or need a hand, reach out to us via the support forums or our website.
