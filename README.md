# Emergency Notice Bar
Super-lightweight WordPress plugin adds an emergency notice bar for covid-19 closures, updates, and more on your WordPress site globally, or only on the home page with just a few clicks.

Love it?  Consider [donating a couple bucks](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WED3F4H3Q35SW&source=url).

## Description
This is a very simple plugin with an equially simple goal: allow site admins to setup, style, and customize a message on their website for Covid-19 closures, updates, and more either on the home page or globally.

Use it over and over again.  Just "Hide" it, reconfigure the background color and content using the same WYSIWYG editor you're used to and then "Unhide it."  Great for emergency notices like Coronavirus updates, tornado information, or just a company holiday.

## Plugin Options
We tried to keep things as simple as possible, but still flexible for many different uses, like Coronavirus notifications, as well as other simple notifications to users. Options for displaying the plugin include:

1. Shown/Hidden
1. Home Page Only or Site-Wide
1. Rich Content (WYSIWYG Editor)
1. Dismissable or Not
1. Full-Width or Container
1. Top or Bottom Positioned
1. Animation and Animation Duration
1. Background Color (unlimited choices)

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Where is the Settings Page? 
Go to **Settings** >> **Notice Bar** to configure and then enable the emergency notice bar.

### Is this plugin really free? 
We thought of creating a "pro" version, but things are tough for everyone right now.  So we decided to release it for free on the WordPress.org repo as well as on GitHub.  If you like it, you'd make our day by giving us a review or, better yet, donate a couple bucks via PayPal using the donate link in the plugin settings.

### Can I add links, headings, and more to the notice? 
Absolutely, yes. The content is edited for the plugin using the familiar WordPress WYSIWYG editor, which works pretty much the same as Word.

### I need it to do something specific. How do I do that? 
We are open to suggestions and believe our plugin will evolve according to ever-chaning requirement. We are user driven and welcome your ideas. Just reach out to us via the support forums or our website.

### Can I add custom CSS? 
You may add custom CSS to your WordPress Customizer. This is done by navigating to "Appearance" >> "Customize" >> "Additional CSS".  For reference, just prepend the CSS ID, "#jdm-notice," to override any built-in CSS.

If you have any trouble or need a hand, reach out to us via the support forums or our website.
