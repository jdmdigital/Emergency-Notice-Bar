Super-lightweight WordPress plugin adds an emergency notice bar for covid-19 closures, updates, and more on your WordPress site globally, or only on the home page with just a few clicks.

## Description
This is a very simple plugin with an equially simple goal: allow site admins to setup, style, and customize a message on their website for Covid-19 closures, updates, and more either on the home page or globally.

Use it over and over again.  Just "Hide" it, reconfigure the background color and content using the same WYSIWYG editor you're used to and then "Unhide it."  Great for emergency notices like Coronavirus updates, tornado information, or just a company holiday.

## Plugin Options
We tried to keep things as simple as possible, but still flexible for many different uses, like Coronavirus notifications, as well as other simple notifications to users. Options for displaying the plugin include:

1. Shown/Hidden
